[Big Nerd Ranch](http://www.bignerdranch.com) Intro to iOS Tutorial at [mdevcon](http://mdevcon.com/posts/2013/01/03/bolot-kerimbaev/).

This is a very simple single-view iOS app that demonstrates a few techniques for iOS development:

- Creating a user interface with the Interface Builder in XIB files
- Connecting the user interface to code, for updating the UI elements and for reacting to user interaction (i.e., UILabels and UIButtons)
- Creating a simple data structure using NSDictionary, NSArray, and NSString for rapid prototyping

This exercise is meant to whet your appetite for iOS development by demonstrating how a simple app can be developed rapidly using Xcode, Interface Builder, and a few Foundation classes.
